# node-dash-wunderlist
Use Amazon Dash Buttons to put things on your grocery wunderlist. Instead of buying them on Amazon.

## Under development, contribute! 
This package is still under heavy development. The install routine does not work out of the box at the moment. I'm new to node and JS so i still have to improve. Please fork if you know how to improve this package! I will write better documentation soon.

# How it works
1. Put dash button on fridge with label of grocery you want to buy
